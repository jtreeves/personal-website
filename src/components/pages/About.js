                In college, I was a humanities major, and that taught me how to think and how to express myself coherently. As a journalist, I learned how to deliver on deadline and internalize specific style guidelines. As a marketer, I learned how to track website traffic and how to customize specific content for different platforms and clientele. As a tutor, I learned how to guide others and got experience with challenges that arise in one-on-one situations in which one party knows drastically more than the other. Additionally, I think I can explain anything to a ten-year-old, which I think means that I should be able to explain anything that I understand to anyone. Now, I hope to parlay all of those skills to become a programmer.
